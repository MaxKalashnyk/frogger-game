# Classic Arcade Game Frogger

[Demo](https://kalash14.github.io/frogger-game/)  |  [Code](https://github.com/kalash14/frogger-game/tree/master/js) 

This task based on one of my successfuly done homeworks from [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans/) frontend [course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend)

It's also a final part of Udacity Object-Oriented JavaScript
[course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud015)

Some functionality was made and students should finish it with knowledge of object-oriented JS from this thory course.

I have also added choosing players before game init, switching on/off sound during playing this game and allow displaying user high score.

In general, it was good practice with HTML5 audio API and canvas. Also, I became more confident in using OOP in JS.
